The data and scripts are deposited for use in replicating results of anaylsis for: Hoover KC, Roberts J, Botescu D, Piotr Fedurek, Aarts S, Berbesque JC. Field-testing olfactory ability to understand human olfactory ecology. American Journal of Human Biology. https://doi.org/10.1002/ajhb.23411 

If using data or scripts for any purpose, please cite the above publication.

data-raw data: these data derive from field data collection sheets and were processed to generate data-kappa and data-field methods
data-kappa: these data (4 sheets) are tests for agreement between observers coding participant responses to odors
data-field methods: these data (5 sheets) were used by the code for analysis in scripts 2-5

script1-kappa: this script calculates the kappa value for inter-observer agreement on coding responses to odor prompts
script2-field: this script contains the code for the field data models (with and without random term), signed ranks test for location, Figures 1-2
script3-lab: this script contains the code for the lab data models (with and without random term), signed ranks test for location, Figures 3-4
script3-fieldlab: this script contains the code for Figure 5
script4-consistency: this script contains the code for consistency test statistic W reported in 3.5 Consistency and Figure 6
