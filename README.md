## Smelling in the Wild
Humans encounter odors in complex, multi-sensory environments – markets, streets, polluted air – yet olfactory research almost exclusively measures ability in controlled lab settings. Whether ambient odor context enhances or impairs identification, and whether lab performance predicts field performance, remains poorly understood. A key open question is whether environmental odor exposure (pollution, food smells) primes or disrupts olfactory ability in real-world settings. This project tests odor identification and verbal description across three London field locations with distinct ambient odor profiles – a neutral art museum, a polluted urban street, and a food market – and a paired controlled lab study replicating clean and food-rich conditions. Fifty-nine participants completed both forced choice identification and free verbal description of five odors at each location, allowing comparison of accuracy, consistency, and response change across settings. Sex and age effects were modeled before testing location effects, and multiple analytical frameworks were applied to assess robustness.

data-raw data: these data derive from field data collection sheets and were processed to generate data-kappa and data-field methods
data-kappa: these data (4 sheets) are tests for agreement between observers coding participant responses to odors
data-field methods: these data (5 sheets) were used by the code for analysis in scripts 2-5

script1-kappa: this script calculates the kappa value for inter-observer agreement on coding responses to odor prompts
script2-field: this script contains the code for the field data models (with and without random term), signed ranks test for location, Figures 1-2
